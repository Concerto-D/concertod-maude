  This file contains the Maude program for Concerto-D
    content: 
    A - several functional modules to describe mainly data types and operations on these types
    B - a system module to describe operational rules.

    A - Functional modules (FM) :
    
    () FM-1- a functional module called DECLARATION-SORTS that defines only a few sorts. 
        Defining these sorts first enables us to create views on them, which allows us to use the views to 
        create predefined Maude structures for our sorts. 
        Example: we need to create a set on our sort Place, so we start with the following steps:
            * declare Place in the first module.
            * build a view `Place` which is mapping from the module `TRIV` to the module `DECLARATION-SORTS`.
              The `TRIV` module is a trivial module which has a single sort Elt. the view will be:

                      view Place from TRIV to DECLARATION-SORTS is
                        sort Elt to Place .
                      endv
              
            * we can then import pr SET{Place} .  
            which allows you to parameterize the predefined module SET{X :: TRIV} by Place and thus define a set structure on Place
    
      Module DECLARATION-SORTS is followed by a view declarations to use (file_2: Views)
    () Basic data are defined in (file_3: 3_Basic-data-type-Concerto) and so on until we end up in file_13 for model-checking.
